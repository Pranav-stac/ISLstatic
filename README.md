# 🤲 Indian Sign Language (ISL) Detection & Generation Project 🇮🇳

Welcome to the **Indian Sign Language Detection and Generation** project! This initiative is aimed at bridging the communication gap by utilizing AI/ML models to detect and generate ISL gestures. The project features real-time gesture detection from videos as well as the ability to generate sign language gestures from text input. Additionally, it offers a mobile app for seamless ISL translation and communication.

## 🌟 Features

### 🤖 ISL Gesture Detection:
- **AI/ML models** (CNN + LSTM) trained on thousands of Indian Sign Language gesture videos.
- Detects sign language gestures from real-time video input.
- Accurately translates ISL gestures into **text** for easy understanding.

### ✍️ ISL Gesture Generation:
- **Text-to-Gesture Conversion**: Input text and generate corresponding ISL gestures.
- Animated ISL generation using pre-trained **pose estimation models**.
  
### 📱 Mobile App:
- **Real-Time ISL Detection**: Capture live video and get real-time ISL-to-text translations.
- **Gesture Generation**: Enter text and generate ISL gestures in real-time.
- **Communication Assistant**: A two-way communication tool where gestures are converted to text and vice versa.
